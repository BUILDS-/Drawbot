Drawbot software for BUILDS CNC machine.

>>drawbot.pde file goes to arduino

>>drawbot.sh, drawbot1.txt, pixelsize.pl, bitstream.pl files belong in same folder

>>drawbotBitStream.m file is for matlab to generate the drawbot1.txt file from images

NOTE: currently this uses functions that are not supported in GNU Octave.  While not a priority for the time being, we plan on having the entire project using free software, as matlab is not widely avaiable for people wishing to replicate our efforts.

==WHAT EACH FILE DOES==
drawbot1.txt - this file contains the bitstream sent from the PC to the arduino, it consist of 1 and 0, representing black and white pixels.  the arduino interprates that if it wants to fire the laser (black) or not (white)
pixelsize.pl - this file reads in drawbot1.txt, finds out how long it is, then square roots it.  because each image is a square, this works.  Then it will send this integer to the arduino.  arduino will now know when each new line starts!
bitstream.pl - takes in drawbot1.txt, reads one char at a time into the arduino.  that way arduino will know to burn or not.
drawbot.sh - runs pixelsize and bitstream, not necessacary, but makes the machine operator's life easier
drawbot.pde - arduino's software, takes in data from the perl scripts to move motors and fire laser
drawBotBitStream.m - MATLAB program takes in a picture, converts it to the drawbot1.txt, does some fancy image processing to do this

>>this uses the Adafruit motor shield, big thanks to ladyada for her shield and code for controlling the steppers.


========PROJECT STATUS========
Currently (as of 3/07/11) under heavy development. 
Software is mostly complete.  Hardware needs some doing
