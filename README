Drawbot software for BUILDS CNC machine.

.pde file goes to arduino

.sh, .txt, .pl files belong in same folder, .m file is for matlab to generate the .txt file from images

this uses the Adafruit motor shield, big thanks to ladyada for her shield and code for controlling the steppers.



Currently (as of 3/04/11) under heavy development.
